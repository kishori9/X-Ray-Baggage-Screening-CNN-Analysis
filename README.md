Terrorist incidents and security threats have been increasing in the past years. This project is intended to explore the restricted and non-restricted items scan in the baggage at the airports and landmarks for the security purpose, and to locate the restricted items in the baggage that may cause the terrorist incidents and security threats.

Enhanced Airport screening will help keep travelers and employees safe by identifying hidden weapons and other restricted items that are not approved for safe travel.
Automating baggage scanning will help improve customer experience as the time needed to be ready for a flight will be reduced.
Airports will become more flexible and ready for all passenger flow changes due to increased baggage throughput rate thereby improving airport baggage operations.
Reduced TSA employee turnover will result in reduced costs and enhanced morale.
The revenue opportunities of airport operators will increase as the passengers will have  more time to spend on shopping, food and entertainment areas.
